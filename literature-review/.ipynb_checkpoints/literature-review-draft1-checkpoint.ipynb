    "* * I believe that I have better dataset with better features in the sense that the features I use is more representative of nature of climbing. What I mean by 'nature of climbing' is that although assessing the difficulty of a boulder problem is not formally and objectively defined in climbing literature, I believe that the feature set I will use will be able to grasp that nature of climbing. Consequently, my model will have better accuracy regarding assessing the difficulty of a moonboard problem."

    "* What standart one may follow to assess a quality of a boulder problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The training board they used in this research is Moonboard 2017 which is a 40$^{\\circ}$ overhang artificial climbing wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem that the aim of my project and this paper does not overlap. To achive their goal, they assessed the difficulty grades of climbing routes. The overlap is here. Although their main goal does not corrensponds to mine, this assessment makes it so. In addition to this, their heuristic approach is valuable here. This heuristic approach will help me to have good feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### * Methods\n",
    "They used greedy tree algorithms to generate a tree which consists of novel boulder problems. In the literature, people used machine learning models to assess the difficulty of a problem. In this research, they think that a heuristic approach will be better, since they found previous work unsuccessful in the sense that their models couldn't assess the difficulty of holds as people do. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To grow a tree, they classified climbing holds, climbing moves and studied influence of these heuristics on the grade of a problem. \n",
    "##### Classification of holds:\n",
    "There are 198 different holds on this board. The classified these holds regarding these aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A difficulty rating of gripping particular hold. They gave a questionnary consists of verbal phrases to experienced climbers to rate how difficult to grip particular hold on a scale of 1 to 5. \n",
    "* The hold's rotational angle to the ground. They defined 8 angles: east, west, south, north, north-west, north-east, etc. \n",
    "* The primary type of the hold: edge, sloper, pinch, etc.\n",
    "* The secondary type of the hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Classification of moves:\n",
    "By watching the videos of people climbing moonboard problems, they summarized the moves made in climbing moonboard problems: using a side pull, 'normal' climbing move, dead-pointing, dyno-ing, using a heel hook, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Influence of heuristics on the difficulty of a problem\n",
    "They listed the heuristics below to assess the difficulty of a problem:\n",
    "* Longer move, harder problem\n",
    "* Harder hold, harder problem\n",
    "* Less footholds, harder problem\n",
    "* More special climbing moves, harder problem\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Score of a hold = \n",
    "Regarding classification of holds, experienced climbers agreed upon the difficulty rate of the hard and easy holds, yet their ratings did not overlap regarding holds neither easy nor hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Score of a hold = (2 * difficulty score + 1 * hold score + 3 * move score + 3 * rotation score) / 9. Each score has own equation which can be seen in the paper.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### * Results\n",
    "They asked experienced climbers to evaulate the routes generated and benchmark moonboard routes: %80 of the benchmark routes have good flow, yet it was %45 for the routes generated by the algorithm. %75 of the benchmark routes are enjoyable, whereas %40 of the generated routes are enjoyable. \n",
    "The main reason behind for this is that the algorithm does not take into account of the full state of the climbers on the routes on each move. What I mean by the full state of the climbers is that, the algorithm does not keep track of the positions of the limbs of the climbers when climbing the route. This leads to awkward moves in generated routes. \n",
    "They compared their grades with people's opinion's on the routed generated. These were pretty close. They were successful to estimate the grades of the routes.   \n",

    "##### * Aim:\n",
    "Their main aim is to develop a model that generate moonboard problems, DeepRouteSet. To achieve this, they develop a pipeline, BetaMove, that returns hand sequence of a given route. This sequence output fed into another model that returns the difficulty grade of a given route, GradeNet. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### * Methods\n",
    "As I briefly mentioned in the aim part, the BetaMove pipeline is developed. It is used to both to train GradeNet, and DeepRouteSet. When given a route, BetaMove generates many possible hand sequences, and returns the one with best scores. Thety used beam search algorithm to find the one with the best score. With these hand sequence data and grade label, they trained both GradeNet, which is a model returns difficulty grade of a route, and DeepRouteSet, that generates novel routes with grade label.\n",
    "They treated this problem of classifying and generating route as an NLP problem. Because of the sequential nature of the climbing routes, they preferred RNN algorithm. Like music generator models, DeepRouteSet learns the patterns between adjoint moves and using these patterns to create new routes. As like sentiment analysis, they used sequantial data of hand sequences like like a textual data and grade information like sentiments. The architectures of DeepRouteSet and GradeNet are below:\n",

    "I also added their figure for BetaMove below. Yet, unfortunately, I did not understand how they compose their 22-dimensional vectors representing moves. Maybe analysing their source code could clarify that 22-dimensional vector.  \n",

    "DeepRouteSet: The generated routes have good flow. Yet, most of the generated routes, at least the ones uploaded to their github repository, are not legitimate MoonBoard routes. Since, it violates the MoonBoard rule 'All start holds must be on row 6 or lower'. They asked an expert to make quality analysis of their generated routes, and latest 50 benchmark MoonBoard problems. Then, they have compared the results of the expert and another quality analysis of routes that are generated by another machine learning model MoonBoard. Their generated routes have the highest scores. The results table they provided is below:\n",

    "##### Discussion:\n",
    "The popularity of sport climbing is increased after it has become an olympic sport in Tokyo 2020. Moreover, as MoonBoard becomes globally used training board for climbers, research papers on it started to show up. The two papers I briefly reviewed are the ones I found the most relevant to my aim in this project. Although main goal of the two papers are different from my project goal, both papers' interest is to generate new moonboard problems, their process includes grade estimation of a MoonBoard problem. There are different reasons why I choosed these two papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I choosed the first one because of its heuristic approach. They have a heuristic approach that reflects insights regarding the nature of climbing. This inspired me to create a dataset with the insights they provided and have a features that grasps the nature of climbing. However, they used tree algorithms to generate new routes, I'm planning to use tree algorithms to estimate the grade of a route instead of generating new routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I choosed the other article because of their choice of machine learning algorithm to the problem. Again, their main goal was to generate new routes, yet, they have a model named GradeNet which predicts the difficulty grade of a problem. They have used Recurrent Neural Network algorithm to estimate the grade of a route. They have represented the routes as sequential datas. I am not sure if it is necessary to have sequential kind of data to estimate grade of a route. I am planning to have a non-sequential dataset that has features inspired from the first article. "
